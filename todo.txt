Development:
	- pass dictionary of root_finders into convert function
	- convert date field to datetime index
	- convert equation based compilation into class based system
	- improve library equation handler 
	- add ability to reference library equation paths IN the sensor files

Tests:
	- Equation tests
		- compilation tests
			- explicit
			- implicit
			- implicit difficult
			- raising applicable errors
		- library tests
			- correctly imports function
			- correctly calculates results
			- from temporary library
			- from additional permanent libraries
	- Utility tests
		- test _get_units
	
- Documentation
	- Tutorials
		- Simple sensor reporting and processing 
		- intermediate sensor reporting and processing
	
	- standardize function documentation into scipy/numpy format with Parameters and Returns
	- Readme
		- intro using simple sensor tutorial
		- special attributes
		- reporting
		- units
		- conversion
		- uncertainty
		- extensive documentation on equation compiler and uncertainty functions
