Development:
	- [X] add class instantation through regular dictionary interface
	- [X] add fromkeys method for SensorArray (i.e. make every key a Sensor for SensorArray)
	- pass dictionary of root_finders into convert function
	- [X] add equation library
		- [X] temporarily
		- [X] permanently
	- [X] write Sensor to yaml
	- [X] write SensorArray to yaml
	- convert date field to datetime index
Tests:
	- [X] Reporting Tests
		- [X ] markdown
			- [X] Sensor
			- [X] SensorArray
		- [X] table
			- [X] tablefmt
			- [X] headerfmt
			- [X] attributes as columns
			- [X] can use existing example as guide

	- Equation tests
		- compilation tests
			- explicit
			- implicit
			- implicit difficult
			- raising applicable errors
		- library tests
			- correctly imports function
			- correctly calculates results
			- from temporary library
			- from additional permanent libraries

	- [X] Uncertainty tests
		- [X] compilation tests
			- [X] correctly discerning units,value from single item
			- [X] correctly discerning units, value in list
			- [X] correctly discerning units,value and operator in list
		- [X] application tests
			- [X] applying percentage 
			- [X] applying constant values
			- [X] applying equations
			- [X] applying operator
	- Utility tests
		- test _get_units
